Review Excerpt (601 Words):
1.(Objective Justification) “The authors change the objective function of GBOW from p(c|\sum w_i) to p(w|\sum c_i).”
2.(Discussion Depth) “This is somewhat justified as dependency based context with a bound representation only has one word available for predicting the context, but it's unclear exactly why that is the case and deserves more discussion.”
3.(Experimental Comparison) “Unfortunately, the authors don't compare any results against the original objective, which is a definite weakness.”
4.(Experimental Detail) “The hyperparameter settings should be discussed further.”
5.(Model Clarity) “In addition, the authors are unclear on exactly what model is trained in section 3.4.”
6.(Terminology Consistency) “Should call ‘unbounded’ context ‘bag of words’.”
7.(Terminology Accuracy) “043: it's the ‘distributional hypothesis’, not the ‘Distributed Hypothesis’.”
8.(Citation Formatting) “069: citations should have a comma instead of semicolon separating them.”
9.(Capitalization Consistency) “074: ‘DEPS’ should be capitalized consistently throughout the paper (usually it appears as ‘Deps’).”
10.(Abstract Emphasis) “Specifically, the authors should put in the abstract that for POS, chunking, and NER, bound representations outperform bag of words representations, and that dependency contexts work better than linear contexts in most cases.”
11.(Typographical Correction) “Typo: ‘How different contexts affect model's performances...’ Should have the word ‘do’.”
