Review Excerpt (140 Words):
1.(Clarity & Structure) “It is well written and structured.”
2.(Experimental Thoroughness) “The experiments are very thoroughly evaluated.”
3.(Community Resources) “The attached software can also benefit the community.”
4.(Novelty) “The novelty is limited.”
5.(Comparison Fairness) “For the dependency based context types, how does the dependency parsing affect the overall performance? Is it fair to compare those two different context types since the dependency based one has to rely on the predicted dependency parsing results (in this case CoreNLP) while the linear one does not?”

Coverage: High (5 Points)

Length Consistency: Compact

Review Quality: Optimal

Confidence Score: 4/5

Reason: The review provides a balanced evaluation, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses, but could be more detailed.

Improvement Suggestion: Provide a concise analysis of how dependency parser errors impact embedding performance to ensure a fair comparison with linear contexts
