Review Excerpt (600 Words):

1.(Objective Justification) “Changes in the GBOW objective function are not adequately justified.”

2.(Experimental Comparison) “No results are compared against the original objectives of GBOW and GSG, which weakens the validity of conclusions.”

3.(Clarity) “The trained models' description in Section 3.4 is unclear and inconsistent with terminology used elsewhere in the paper.”

4.(Terminology Consistency) “References to 'unbounded context' as 'bag of words' could confuse readers.”

5.(Typographical Correction) “Typo: ‘Distributed Hypothesis’ should be ‘Distributional Hypothesis’.”

6.(Abstract Emphasis) “Key findings, such as dependency context outperforming linear contexts in most cases, should be highlighted in the abstract.”
