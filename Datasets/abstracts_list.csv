"Integrating text and knowledge into a unified semantic space has attracted significant research interests recently. However, the ambiguity in the common space remains a challenge, namely that the same mention phrase usually refers to various entities. In this paper, to deal with the ambiguity of entity mentions, we propose a novel Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding model, which learns multiple sense embeddings for each mention by jointly modeling words from textual contexts and entities derived from a knowledge base. In addition, we further design an efficient language model based approach to disambiguate each mention to a specific sense. In experiments, both qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrate the high quality of the word, entity and multi-prototype mention embeddings. Using entity linking as a study case, we apply our disambiguation method as well as the multi-prototype mention embeddings on the benchmark dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art performance."

"We present a neural model for morphological inflection generation which employs a hard attention mechanism, inspired by the nearly-monotonic alignment commonly found between the characters in a word and the characters in its inflection. We evaluate the model on three previously studied morphological inflection generation datasets and show that it provides state of the art results in various setups compared to previous neural and non-neural approaches. Finally we present an analysis of the continuous representations learned by both the hard and soft (Bahdanau, 2014) attention models for the task, shedding some light on the features such models extract."

"The state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER) systems are supervised machine learning models that require large amounts of manually annotated data to achieve high accuracy. However, annotating NER data by human is expensive and time-consuming, and can be quite difficult for a new language. In this paper, we present two weakly supervised approaches for cross-lingual NER with no human annotation in a target language. The first approach is to create automatically labeled NER data for a target language via annotation projection on comparable corpora, where we develop a heuristic scheme that effectively selects good-quality projection-labeled data from noisy data. The second approach is to project distributed representations of words (word embeddings) from a target language to a source language, so that the source-language NER system can be applied to the target language without re-training. We also design two co-decoding schemes that effectively combine the outputs of the two projection-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches on both in-house and open NER data for several target languages. The results show that the combined systems outperform three other weakly supervised approaches on the CoNLL data."

"In this paper, we propose a new model for predicting overlapping entities based on multigraphs, as opposed to simple graphs commonly used in graphical models for structured predictions. Through experiments in standard datasets containing overlapping and non-overlapping entities, we demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models. We also present some analysis on the differences between our model and the previous models and discuss the possible implications of the differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structured prediction model utilizing multigraphs to predict overlapping structures."

"Relation detection is a core component of many NLP applications including Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). In this paper, we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network enhanced by residual learning which detects KB relations given an input question. Our method uses deep residual bidirectional LSTMs to compare questions and relation names via different levels of abstraction. Additionally, we propose a simple KBQA system that integrates entity linking and our proposed relation detector to make the two components enhance each other. Our experimental results show that our approach not only achieves outstanding relation detection performance, but more importantly, it helps our KBQA system achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA benchmarks."
"Extracting time expressions from free text is a fundamental task for many applications. We analyze the time expressions from four datasets and find that only a small group of words are used to express time information, and the words in time expressions demonstrate similar syntactic behaviour. Based on the findings, we propose a type-based approach, named SynTime, to recognize time expressions. Specifically, we define three main syntactic token types, namely time token, modifier, and numeral, to group time-related regular expressions over tokens. On the types we design general heuristic rules to recognize time expressions. In recognition, SynTime first identifies the time tokens from raw text, then searches their surroundings for modifiers and numerals to form time segments, and finally merges the time segments to time expressions. As a light-weight rule-based tagger, SynTime runs in real time, and can be easily expanded by simply adding keywords for the text of different types and of different domains. Experiment on benchmark datasets and tweets data shows that SynTime outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

"One of the core components of modern spoken dialogue systems is the belief tracker, which estimates the user's goal at every step of the dialogue. However, most current approaches have difficulty scaling to larger, more complex dialogue domains. This is due to their dependency on either: a) Spoken Language Understanding models that require large amounts of annotated training data; or b) hand-crafted lexicons for capturing some of the linguistic variation in users' language. We propose a novel Neural Belief Tracking (NBT) framework which overcomes these problems by building on recent advances in representation learning. NBT models reason over pre-trained word vectors, learning to compose them into distributed representations of user utterances and dialogue context. Our evaluation on two datasets shows that this approach surpasses past limitations, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models which rely on hand-crafted semantic lexicons and outperforming them when such lexicons are not provided."

"Natural language understanding (NLU) is a core component of a dialogue system. Recently recurrent neural networks (RNN) obtained strong results on NLU due to their superior ability of preserving sequential information over time.  Traditionally, the NLU module tags semantic slots for utterances considering their flat structures, as the underlying RNN structure is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits linguistic properties that provide rich, structured information for better understanding. This paper introduces a novel model, knowledge-guided structural attention networks (K-SAN), a generalization of RNN to additionally incorporate non-flat network topologies guided by prior knowledge. There are two characteristics: 1) important substructures can be captured from small training data, allowing the model to generalize to previously unseen test data; 2) the model automatically figures out the salient substructures that are essential to predict the semantic tags of the given sentences, so that the understanding performance can be improved.  The experiments on the benchmark ATIS data show that the proposed K-SAN architecture can effectively extract salient knowledge from substructures with an attention mechanism, and outperform the state-of-the-art neural network based frameworks."
"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose. Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts.  In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments."

"We investigate neural techniques for end-to-end computational argumentation mining (AM). We frame AM both as a token-based dependency parsing and as a token-based sequence tagging problem, including a multi-task learning setup. Contrary to models that operate on the argument component level, we find that framing AM as dependency parsing leads to subpar performance results. In contrast, less complex (local) tagging models based on BiLSTMs perform robustly across classification scenarios, being able to catch long-range dependencies inherent to the AM problem. Moreover, we find that jointly learning `natural' subtasks, in a multi-task learning setup, improves performance."

"Word embeddings provide point representations of words containing useful semantic information.  We introduce multimodal word distributions formed from Gaussian mixtures, for multiple word meanings, entailment, and rich uncertainty information.  To learn these distributions, we propose an energy-based max-margin objective. We show that the resulting approach captures uniquely  expressive semantic information, and outperforms alternatives, such as word2vec skip-grams, and Gaussian embeddings, on benchmark datasets such as word similarity and entailment."

"Neural machine translation aims at building a single large neural network that can be trained to maximize translation performance. The encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism achieves a translation performance comparable to the existing phrase-based systems. However, the use of large vocabulary becomes the bottleneck in both training and improving the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture which learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder which translates at character level. This gives rise to a deep character-level model consisting of six recurrent networks. Such a deep model has two major advantages. It avoids the large vocabulary issue radically; at the same time, it is more efficient in training than word-based models and conventional character-based models. Our model obtains a higher BLEU score than the bpe-based model after training for one epoch on En-Fr and En-Cs translation tasks. Moreover, the final BLEU score of our model is comparable to the state-of-the-art systems. Further analyses show that our model is able to learn morphology."

"This paper tackles the task of event detection (ED), which involves identifying and categorizing events. We argue that arguments provide significant clues to this task, but they are either completely ignored or exploited in an indirect manner in existing detection approaches. In this work, we propose to exploit argument information explicitly for ED via supervised attention mechanisms. In specific, we systematically investigate the proposed model under the supervision of different attention strategies. Experimental results show that our approach advances state-of-the-arts and achieves the best F1 score on ACE 2005 dataset."
"Until now, error type performance for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems could only be measured in terms of recall because system output is not annotated. To overcome this problem, we introduce ERRANT, a grammatical ERRor ANnotation Toolkit designed to automatically extract edits from parallel original and corrected sentences and classify them according to a new, dataset-agnostic, rule-based framework. This not only facilitates error type evaluation at different levels of granularity, but can also be used to reduce annotator workload and standardise existing GEC datasets. Human experts rated the automatic edits as ``Good'' or ``Acceptable'' in at least 95\% of cases, so we applied ERRANT to the system output of the CoNLL-2014 shared task to carry out a detailed error type analysis for the first time."

"Recent work on embedding ontology concepts has relied on either expensive manual annotation or automated concept tagging methods that ignore the textual contexts around concepts.  We propose a novel method for jointly learning concept, phrase, and word embeddings from an unlabeled text corpus, by using the representative phrases for ontology concepts as distant supervision.  We learn embeddings for medical concepts in the Unified Medical Language System and general-domain concepts in YAGO, using various corpora.  Our embeddings show performance competitive with existing methods on concept similarity and relatedness tasks, while requiring no human corpus annotation and demonstrating more than 3x coverage in the vocabulary size."

"Cloze-style reading comprehension is a representative problem in mining relationship between document and query. In this paper, we present a simple but novel model called attention-over-attention reader for better solving cloze-style reading comprehension task. The proposed model aims to place another attention mechanism over the document-level attention and induces ``attended attention'' for final answer predictions. One advantage of our model is that it is simpler than related works while giving excellent performance. In addition to the primary model, we also propose an N-best re-ranking strategy to double check the validity of the candidates and further improve the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin in public datasets, such as CNN and Children's Book Test."
"One weakness of machine-learned NLP models is that they typically perform poorly on out-of-domain data. In this work, we study the task of identifying products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, which exhibits particularly challenging cross-domain effects. We formulate a task that represents a hybrid of slot-filling information extraction and named entity recognition and annotate datasets consisting of data from four different forums. Each of these forums constitutes its own ""fine-grained domain"" in that the forums cover different market sectors with different properties, even though all forums are in the broad domain of cybercrime. We characterize these domain differences in the context of a learning-based system: supervised models see decreased accuracy when applied to new forums, and standard techniques for semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation have limited effectiveness on this data, which suggests the need to improve these techniques.  We release a dataset of 93,924 posts from across 4 forums, with annotations for 1,938 posts."
"Multimodal sentiment analysis is a developing area of research, which involves the identification of sentiments in videos. Current research considers utterances as independent entities, i.e., ignores the interdependencies and relations among the utterances of a video. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-based model that enables utterances to capture contextual information from their surroundings in the same video, thus aiding the classification process. Our method shows 5-10% performance improvement over the state of the art and high robustness to generalizability."
"Most existing approaches for zero pronoun resolution are heavily relying on annotated data, which is often released by shared task organizers. Therefore, the lack of annotated data becomes a major obstacle in the progress of zero pronoun resolution task.  Also, it is expensive to spend manpower on labeling the data for better performance. To alleviate the problem above, in this paper, we propose a simple but novel approach to automatically generate large-scale pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution. Furthermore, we successfully transfer the cloze-style reading comprehension neural network model into zero pronoun resolution task and propose a two-step training mechanism to overcome the gap between the pseudo training data and the real one. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems with an absolute improvements of 3.1\% F-score on OntoNotes 5.0 data."

"We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex semantic units. To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is not supported by any existing parser. Our transition-based parser, which uses a novel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not just for UCCA parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can inform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in languages that frequently use discontinuous structures."

"The number of word embedding models is growing every year. Most of them learn word embeddings based on the co-occurrence information of words and their contexts. However, it's still an open question what is the best definition of context. We provide the first systematical investigation of different context types and context representations for learning word embeddings. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate their effectiveness under 6 tasks, which give us some insights about context selection. We hope that this paper, along with the published code, can serve as a guideline of choosing context for our community."

"Finding the correct hypernyms for entities is essential for taxonomy learning, fine-grained entity categorization, query understanding, etc. Due to the flexibility of the Chinese language, it is challenging to identify hypernyms in Chinese accurately. Rather than extracting hypernyms from texts, in this paper, we present a transductive learning approach to establish mappings from entities to hypernyms in the embedding space directly. It combines linear and non-linear embedding projection models, with the capacity of encoding arbitrary language-specific rules. Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate that our approach outperforms previous methods for Chinese hypernym prediction."

"Discourse structure analysis is helpful for the machine to identify different types of discourse writing styles, and lays the foundation for the study of discourse automatic generation. In this paper, after studying the difference and the relationship between micro and macro discourse structures, we explore the macro discourse structure, and put forward a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDTB) on the top of existing Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB), by unifying micro and macro discourse structures. Especially, at the micro level, we put forward the primary-secondary relationship from the logical semantic perspective, while at the macro level, we put forward the primary-secondary relationship from the pragmatic function perspective. Preliminary experiments show that our macro-micro unified schema is appropriate for the discourse structure analysis."

"This paper presents an LDA-based model that generates topically coherent segments within documents by jointly segmenting documents and assigning topics to their words. The coherence between topics is ensured through a copula, binding the topics associated to the words of a segment. In addition, this model relies on both document and segment specific topic distributions so as to capture fine grained differences in topic assignments. We show that the proposed model naturally encompasses other state-of-the-art LDA-based models designed for similar tasks. Furthermore, our experiments, conducted on six different publicly available datasets, show the effectiveness of our model in terms of perplexity, Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information, which captures the coherence between the generated topics, and the Micro F1 measure for text classification."

"Named entities are frequently used in a metonymic manner. They serve as references to related entities such as people and organisations. Accurate identification and interpretation of metonymy can be directly beneficial to various NLP applications, such as Named Entity Recognition and Geographical Parsing. Until now, metonymy resolution (MR) methods mainly relied on parsers, taggers, dictionaries, external word lists and other handcrafted lexical resources. We show how a minimalist neural approach combined with a novel predicate window method can achieve competitive results on the SemEval 2007 task on Metonymy Resolution. Additionally, we contribute with a new Wikipedia-based MR dataset called RelocaR, which is tailored towards locations as well as improving previous deficiencies in annotation guidelines."
"Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in information extraction. To tackle this problem, we firstly propose a novel tagging scheme that can convert the joint extraction task to a tagging problem.. Then, based on our tagging scheme, we study different end-to-end models to extract entities and their relations directly, without identifying entities and relations separately. We conduct experiments on a public dataset produced by distant supervision method and the experimental results show that the tagging based methods are better than most of the existing pipelined and joint learning methods. What’s more, the end-to-end model proposed in this paper, achieves the best results on the public dataset."
"The paper presents a procedure of building an evaluation dataset. for the validation of compositional distributional semantics models estimated for languages other than English. The procedure generally builds on steps designed to assemble the SICK corpus, which contains pairs of English sentences annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment, because we aim at building a comparable dataset. However, the implementation of particular building steps significantly differs from the original SICK design assumptions, which is caused by both lack of necessary extraneous resources for an investigated language and the need for language-specific transformation rules. The designed procedure is verified on Polish, a fusional language with a relatively free word order, and contributes to building a Polish evaluation dataset. The resource consists of 10K sentence pairs which are human-annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment. The dataset may be used for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantics models of Polish."
"This study implements a vector space model approach to measure the sentiment orientations of words. Two representative vectors for positive/negative polarity are constructed using high-dimensional vec-tor space in both an unsupervised and a semi-supervised manner. A sentiment ori-entation value per word is determined by taking the difference between the cosine distances against the two reference vec-tors. These two conditions (unsupervised and semi-supervised) are compared against an existing unsupervised method (Turney, 2002). As a result of our experi-ment, we demonstrate that this novel ap-proach significantly outperforms the pre-vious unsupervised approach and is more practical and data efficient as well."

"Recent practice in word embeddings points towards importance of learning specialized representations.  Additionally, in many applications purely unsupervised training is useful only under limited dataset size. We argue that focus of word representation evaluation should reflect those trends and shift towards evaluating what \emph{useful} information is \emph{easily} accessible. Specifically, we argue that evaluation should focus on data efficiency and simple supervised tasks, where the amount of available data should be varied and scores of a \emph{supervised} model for each subset should be reported (as commonly done in transfer learning).   In order to illustrate significance of such analysis, a comprehensive evaluation of selected word embeddings is presented. Proposed approach yields a more complete picture and  brings new insight into performance characteristics, for instance information about word similarity or analogy tends to be non--linearly encoded in the embedding space, which questions the cosine--based, unsupervised, evaluation methods.  All results and analysis scripts are available online."

"In recent years word-embedding models have gained great popularity due to their remarkable performance on several tasks, including word analogy questions and caption generation. An unexpected ""side-effect"" of such models is that their vectors often exhibit compositionality, i.e., \emph{adding} two word-vectors results in a vector that is only a small angle away from the vector of a word representing the semantic composite of the original words, e.g., ""man"" + ""royal"" = ""king"".  This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. In particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the process generating the corpus. As a corollary, it explains the success of vector calculus in solving word analogies. When these assumptions do not hold, this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator.   Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby: the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. This shows that Skip-Gram embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further, implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models can be used to fit SDR models."
"While recent neural encoder-decoder models have shown great promise in modeling open-domain conversations, they often generate dull and generic responses. Unlike past work that has focused on diversifying the output of the decoder from word-level to alleviate this problem, we present a novel framework based on conditional variational autoencoders that capture the discourse-level diversity in the encoder. Our model uses latent variables to learn a distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse responses using only greedy decoders. We have further developed a novel variant that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance. Finally, the training procedure is improved through introducing a bag-of-word loss. Our proposed models have been validated to generate significantly more diverse responses than baseline approaches and exhibit competence of discourse-level decision-making."

"With the rapid growth of knowledge bases (KBs) on the web, how to take full advantage of them becomes increasingly important. Question answering over knowledge base (KB-QA) is one of the  promising approaches to access the substantial knowledge. Meanwhile, as the neural network-based (NN-based) methods develop, NN-based KB-QA has already achieved impressive results. However, previous work did not put more emphasis on question representation, and the question is converted into a fixed vector regardless of its candidate answers. This simple representation strategy is not easy to express the proper information in the question. Hence, we present an end-to-end neural network model to represent the questions and their corresponding scores dynamically according to the various candidate answer aspects via cross-attention mechanism. In addition, we leverage the global knowledge inside the underlying KB, aiming at integrating the rich KB information into the representation of the answers. As a result, it could alleviates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem, which helps the cross-attention model to represent the question more precisely. The experimental results on WebQuestions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

"Current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques rely heavily on pre-trained word embeddings. However, the data used to train these embeddings normally comes from large, generic datasets, such as Wikipedia or GoogleNews, which may not include enough task-specific information to create reliable representations. This paper proposes a method to determine the subjectivity of a corpus using available tools and shows that word embeddings trained on task-specific corpora tend to outperform those trained on generic data. We then examine ways to combine information from generic and task-specific datasets and finally demonstrate that our method can work well for under-resourced languages."

"Reasoning and inference are central to human and artificial intelligence. Modeling inference in human language is very challenging. With the availability of large annotated data (Bowman et al., 2015), it has recently become feasible to train neural network based inference models, which have shown to be very effective. In this paper, we present a new state-of-the-art result, achieving the accuracy of 88.6% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference Dataset. Unlike the previous top models that use very complicated network architectures, we first demonstrate that carefully designing sequential inference models based on chain LSTMs can outperform all previous models. Based on this, we further show that by explicitly considering recursive architectures in both local inference modeling and inference composition, we achieve additional improvement. Particularly, incorporating syntactic parsing information contributes to our best result---it further improves the performance even when added to the already very strong model."

"We propose a sequence labeling framework with a secondary training objective, learning to predict surrounding words for every word in the dataset. This language modeling objective incentivises the system to learn general-purpose patterns of semantic and syntactic composition, which are also useful for improving accuracy on different sequence labeling tasks. The architecture was evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of error detection in learner texts, named entity recognition, chunking and POS-tagging. The novel language modeling objective provided consistent performance improvements on every benchmark, without requiring any additional annotated or unannotated data."

"A writer's style depends not just on personal traits but also on her intent and mental state. In this paper, we show how variants of the same writing task can lead to measurable differences in writing style. We present a case study based on the  story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a), where annotators were assigned similar writing tasks with different constraints: (1) writing an entire story, (2) adding a story ending for a given story context, and (3) adding an incoherent ending to a story. We show that a simple linear classifier informed with stylistic features is able to successfully distinguish between the three cases, without even looking at the story context. In addition, our style-based classifier establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, substantially higher than previous results based on deep learning models. Our results demonstrate that different task framings can dramatically affect the way people write."

"Event factuality identification plays an important role in deep NLP applications. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for this task which first extracts essential information from raw texts as the inputs and then identifies the factuality of events via a deep neural network with a proper combination of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The experimental results on FactBank show that our framework significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines."

"Sememes are minimum semantic units of word meanings, and the meaning of each word sense is typically composed by several sememes. Since sememes are not explicit for each word, people manually annotate word sememes and form linguistic common-sense knowledge bases. In this paper, we present that, word sememe information can improve word representation learning (WRL), which maps words into a low-dimensional semantic space and serves as a fundamental step for many NLP tasks. The key idea is to utilize word sememes to capture exact meanings of a word within specific contexts accurately. More specifically, we follow the framework of Skip-gram and present three sememe-encoded models to learn representations of sememes, senses and words, where we apply the attention scheme to detect word senses in various contexts. We conduct experiments on two tasks including word similarity and word analogy, and our models significantly outperform baselines. The results indicate that WRL can benefit from sememes via the attention scheme, and also confirm our models being capable of correctly modeling sememe information."

"Different linguistic perspectives causes many diverse segmentation criteria for Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Most existing methods focus on improve the performance for each single criterion. However, it is interesting to exploit these different criteria and mining their common underlying knowledge. In this paper, we propose adversarial multi-criteria learning for CWS by integrating shared knowledge from multiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria.  Experiments on eight corpora with heterogeneous segmentation criteria show that the performance of each corpus obtains a significant improvement, compared to single-criterion learning.

"This paper deals with sentence-level sentiment classification. Though a variety of neural network models have been proposed recently, however, previous models either depend on expensive phrase-level annotation, most of which has remarkably degraded performance when trained with only sentence-level annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words). In this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. Results show that our models are able to capture the linguistic role of sentiment words, negation words, and intensity words in sentiment expression."

"Concept maps can be used to concisely represent important information and bring structure into large document collections. Therefore, we study a variant of multi-document summarization that produces summaries in the form of concept maps. However, suitable evaluation datasets for this task are currently missing. To close this gap, we present a newly created corpus of concept maps that summarize heterogeneous collections of web documents on educational topics. It was created using a novel crowdsourcing approach that allows us to efficiently determine important elements in large document collections. We release the corpus along with a baseline system and proposed evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization."

"We propose a selective encoding model to extend the sequence-to-sequence framework for abstractive sentence summarization. It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and an attention equipped decoder. The sentence encoder and decoder are built with recurrent neural networks. The selective gate network constructs a second level sentence representation by controlling the information flow from encoder to decoder. The second level representation is tailored for sentence summarization task, which leads to better performance.

"In this paper, we present the gated self-matching networks for reading comprehension style question answering, which aims to answer questions from a given passage. We first match the question and passage with gated attention-based recurrent networks to obtain the question-aware passage representation. Then we propose a self-matching attention mechanism to refine the representation by matching the passage against itself, which effectively encodes information from the whole passage. We finally employ the pointer networks to locate the positions of answers from the passages. We conduct extensive experiments on the SQuAD dataset. The single model achieves 71.3% on the evaluation metrics of exact match on the hidden test set, while the ensemble model further boosts the results to 75.9%. At the time of submission of the paper, our model holds the first place on the SQuAD leaderboard for both single and ensemble model."

This paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam for cold-start problem, by learning to represent the new reviewers' review with jointly embedded textual and behavioral information. Experimental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance and possesses preferable domain-adaptability. It is also applicable to a large scale dataset in an unsupervised way."

"Neural word segmentation research has benefited from large-scale raw texts by leveraging them for pretraining character and word embeddings. On the other hand, statistical segmentation research has exploited richer sources of external information, such as punctuation, automatic segmentation and POS. We investigate the effectiveness of a range of external training sources for neural word segmentation by building a modular segmentation model, pretraining the most important submodule using rich external sources. Results show that such pretraining significantly improves the model, leading to accuracies competitive to the best methods on six benchmarks."
"Modern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data."
"Automated processing of historical texts often relies on pre-normalization to modern word forms. Training encoder-decoder architectures to solve such problems typically requires a lot of training data, which is not available for the named task. We address this problem by using several novel encoder-decoder architectures, including a multi-task learning (MTL) architecture using a grapheme-to-phoneme dictionary as auxiliary data, pushing the state-of-the-art by an absolute 2% increase in performance. We analyze the induced models across 44 different texts from Early New High German. Interestingly, we observe that, as previously conjectured, multi-task learning can learn to focus attention during decoding, in ways remarkably similar to recently proposed attention mechanisms. This, we believe, is an important step toward understanding how MTL works."

"The majority of NLG evaluation relies on automatic metrics, such as BLEU. In this paper, we investigate a wide range of these metrics, including state-of-the-art word-based and novel grammar-based ones, and demonstrate that they only weakly reflect human judgements of system outputs as generated by data-driven, end-to-end NLG. A detailed error analysis shows that automatic metrics are particularly bad in distinguishing outputs of medium and good quality, which can be partially attributed to the fact that human judgements and metrics are given on different scales. We also show that metric performance is data and system specific.  We then suggest an alternative metric, called RAINBOW, combining the individual strengths of different automatic scores. This new metric achieves up to rho=.81 correlation with human judgements on the sentence level (compared to a maximum of rho=.33  for existing metrics) and achieves stable results across systems and data sets."
"Morphology in unbalanced languages remains a big challenge in the context of machine translation. In this paper, we propose to de-couple machine translation from morphology generation in order to better deal with the problem. We investigate the morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between expected gain and generation complexity. For the Chinese-Spanish task, optimum morphological simplification is in gender and number. For this purpose, we design a new classification architecture which, compared to other standard machine learning techniques, obtains the best results. This proposed neural-based architecture consists of several layers: an embedding, a convolutional followed by a recurrent neural network and, finally, ends with sigmoid and softmax layers. We obtain classification results over 98% accuracy in gender classification, over 93% in number classification, and an overall translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR."

"Morphology in unbalanced languages remains a big challenge in the context of machine translation. In this paper, we propose to de-couple machine translation from morphology generation in order to better deal with the problem. We investigate the morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between expected gain and generation complexity. For the Chinese-Spanish task, optimum morphological simplification is in gender and number. For this purpose, we design a new classification architecture which, compared to other standard machine learning techniques, obtains the best results. This proposed neural-based architecture consists of several layers: an embedding, a convolutional followed by a recurrent neural network and, finally, ends with sigmoid and softmax layers. We obtain classification results over 98% accuracy in gender classification, over 93% in number classification, and an overall translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR."
"Network embedding (NE) is playing a critical role in network analysis, due to its ability to represent vertices with efficient low-dimensional embedding vectors. However, existing NE models aim to learn a fixed context-free embedding for each vertex and neglect the diverse roles when interacting with other vertices. In this paper, we assume that one vertex usually shows different aspects when interacting with different neighbor vertices, and should own different embeddings respectively. Therefore, we present Context-Aware Network Embedding (CANE), a novel NE model to address this issue. CANE learns context-aware embeddings for vertices with mutual attention mechanism and is expected to model the semantic relationships between vertices more precisely. In experiments, we compare our model with existing NE models on three real-world datasets. Experimental results show that CANE achieves significant improvement than state-of-the-art methods on link prediction and comparable performance on vertex classification. The source code and datasets can be obtained from \url{https://github.com/thunlp/CANE}."
"In this article, we explore how text mining can help producing reliable, high-level numerical data for multi-document relation extraction applications. We combine neural network techniques, information aggregation and visualization methods to extract event-based relations with a good tolerance to noise. We describe a search engine based on these methods, identifying the evolution of alliance and opposition relations between countries."
"In this paper, we present a novel framework for semi-automatically creating linguistically challenging micro-planning data-to-text corpora from existing Knowledge Bases. Because our method pairs data of varying size and shape with texts ranging from simple clauses to short texts, a dataset created using this framework provides a challenging benchmark for microplanning. Another feature of this framework is that it can be applied to any large scale knowledge base and can therefore be used to train and learn KB verbalisers.  We apply our framework to DBpedia data and compare the resulting dataset with Wen et al. 2016's. We show that while Wen et al.'s dataset is more than twice larger than ours, it is less diverse both in terms of input and in terms of text. We thus propose our corpus generation framework as a novel method for creating challenging data sets from which NLG models can be learned which are capable of handling the complex interactions occurring during in micro-planning between lexicalisation, aggregation, surface realisation, referring expression generation and sentence segmentation. To encourage researchers to take up this challenge, we made available a dataset of 21,855 data/text pairs created using this framework in the context of the WebNLG shared task."

"We present a method for populating fine-grained classes (e.g., “1950s American jazz musicians”) with instances (e.g., Charles Mingus ). While state-of-the-art methods tend to treat class labels as single lexical units, the proposed method considers each of the individual modifiers in the class label relative to the head. An evaluation on the task of reconstructing Wikipedia category pages demonstrates a >10 point increase in AUC, over a strong baseline relying on widely-used Hearst patterns."

"Cognitive NLP systems- i.e., NLP systems that make use of behavioral data - augment traditional text-based features with cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns, EEG signals, brain-imaging etc. Such extraction of features is typically manual. We contend that manual extraction of features may not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that characteristically prevail in complex classification tasks like Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection, and that even the extraction and choice of features should be delegated to the learning system.  We introduce a framework to automatically extract cognitive features from the eye-movement/gaze data of human readers reading the text and use them as features along with textual features for the tasks of sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection. Our proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and text and uses them to classify the input text. We test our technique on published sentiment and sarcasm labeled datasets, enriched with gaze information, to show that using a combination of automatically learned text and gaze features often yields better classification performance over (i)  CNN based systems that rely on text input alone and (ii) existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features."

"Universal Dependencies (UD) provides a cross-linguistically uniform syntactic representation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications of parsing and natural language understanding. Reddy et al. (2016) recently developed a semantic interface for (English) Stanford Dependencies, based on the lambda calculus.  In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a similar semantic interface for UD, which allows mapping natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent framework. We evaluate our approach on semantic parsing for the task of question answering against Freebase.  To facilitate multilingual evaluation, we provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets. Results show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and datasets.  For English, it achieves the strongest result to date on GraphQuestions, with competitive results on WebQuestions."
"This paper proposes DRL-Sense--a multi-sense word representation learning model, to address the word sense ambiguity issue, where a sense selection module and a sense representation module are jointly learned in a reinforcement learning fashion. A novel reward passing procedure is proposed to enable joint training on the selection and representation modules. The modular design implements pure sense-level representation learning with linear time sense selection (decoding). We further develop a non-parametric learning algorithm and a sense exploration mechanism for better flexibility and robustness. The experiments on benchmark data show that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on contextual word similarities and comparable performance with Google's word2vec while using much less training data."

"We present a novel cross-lingual transfer method for paradigm completion, the task of mapping a lemma to its inflected forms, using a neural encoder-decoder model, the state of the art for the monolingual task. We use labeled data from a high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In experiments on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we obtain up to 58% higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even zero-shot and one-shot learning are possible. We further find that the degree of language relatedness strongly influences the ability to transfer morphological knowledge."
"Singlish can be interesting to the ACL community both linguistically as a major creole based on English, and computationally for information extraction and sentiment analysis of regional social media. We investigate dependency parsing of Singlish by constructing a dependency treebank under the Universal Dependencies scheme, and then training a neural network model by integrating English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser trained on the Singlish treebank. Results show that English knowledge can lead to 25% relative error reduction, resulting in a parser of 84.47% accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use neural stacking to improve cross-lingual dependency parsing on low-resource languages. We make both our annotation and parser available for further research."

"We propose a new A* CCG parsing model in which the probability of a tree is decomposed into factors of CCG categories and its syntactic dependencies both defined on bi-directional LSTMs. Our factored model allows the precomputation of all probabilities and runs very efficiently, while modeling sentence structures explicitly via dependencies. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on English and Japanese CCG parsing."

"Language generation tasks that seek to mimic human ability to use language creatively are difficult to evaluate, since one must consider creativity, style, and other non-trivial aspects of the generated text. The goal of this paper is to develop evaluation methods for one such task, ghostwriting of rap lyrics, and to provide an explicit, quantifiable foundation for the goals and future directions of this task. Ghostwriting must produce text that is similar in style to the emulated artist, yet distinct in content. We develop a novel evaluation methodology that addresses several complementary aspects of this task, and illustrate how such evaluation can be used to meaningfully analyze system performance. We provide a corpus of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for stylistic similarity, which allows us to assess the feasibility of manual evaluation for generated verse."

"We show that discourse structure, as defined by Rhetorical Structure Theory and provided by an existing discourse parser, benefits text categorization.  Our approach uses a recursive neural network and a newly proposed attention mechanism to compute a representation of the text that focuses on salient content, from the perspective of both RST and the task.  Experiments consider variants of the approach and illustrate its strengths and weaknesses."

"Volatility prediction—an essential concept in financial markets—has recently been addressed using sentiment analysis methods. We investigate the sentiment of annual disclosures of companies in stock markets to forecast volatility. We specifically explore the use of recent Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models that are effectively extended by related terms using word embeddings. In parallel to textual information, factual market data have been widely used as the mainstream approach to forecast market risk. We therefore study different fusion methods to combine text and market data resources. Our word embedding-based approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we investigate the characteristics of the reports of the companies in different financial sectors."

"Most methods to learn bilingual word embeddings rely on large parallel corpora, which is difficult to obtain for most language pairs. This has motivated an active research line to relax this requirement, with methods that use document-aligned corpora or bilingual dictionaries of a few thousand words instead. In this work, we further reduce the need of bilingual resources using a very simple self-learning approach that can be combined with any dictionary-based mapping technique. Our method exploits the structural similarity of embedding spaces, and works with as little bilingual evidence as a 25 word dictionary or even an automatically generated list of numerals, obtaining results comparable to those of systems that use richer resources."

"Words can be represented by composing the representations of subword units such as word segments, characters, and/or character n-grams. While such representations are effective and may capture the morphological regularities of words, they have not been systematically compared, and it is not understood how they interact with different morphological typologies. On a language modeling task, we present experiments that systematically vary (1) the basic unit of representation, (2) the composition of these representations, and (3) the morphological typology of the language modeled. Our results extend previous findings that character representations are effective across typologies, and we find that a previously unstudied combination of character trigram representations composed with bi-LSTMs outperforms most others. But we also find room for improvement: none of the character-level models match the predictive accuracy of a model with access to true morphological analyses, even when learned from an order of magnitude more data."

"In this paper, we aim to understand whether current language and vision (LaVi) models truly grasp the interaction between the two modalities. To this end, we propose an extension of the MS-COCO dataset, FOIL-COCO, which associates images with both correct and `foil' captions, that is, descriptions of the image that are highly similar to the original ones, but contain one single mistake (`foil word'). We show that current LaVi models fall into the traps of this data and perform badly on three tasks: a) caption  classification (correct vs. foil); b) foil word detection; c) foil word correction. Humans, in contrast, have near-perfect performance on those tasks. We demonstrate that merely utilising language cues is not enough to model FOIL-COCO and that it challenges the state-of-the-art by requiring a fine-grained understanding of the relation between text and image."
"Argumentation mining seeks to uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text. In order to determine this structure, one must understand how different individual components of the overall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on the dual tasks of extracting links between argument components, and classifying types of argument components. We propose to use a joint model based on a Pointer Network architecture to simultaneously solve these tasks. In doing so, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links between argument components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art results on two separate evaluation corpora, achieving far superior performance than a regular Pointer Network model. Our results show that optimizing for both tasks is crucial for high performance."

"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) has become a popular alternative to conventional DNN/HMM systems because it avoids the need for linguistic resources such as pronunciation dictionary, tokenization, and context-dependency trees, leading to a greatly simplified model-building process. There are two major types of end-to-end architectures for ASR:  attention-based methods use an attention mechanism to perform alignment between acoustic frames and recognized symbols, and connectionist temporal classification (CTC), uses Markov assumptions to efficiently solve sequential problems by dynamic programming. This paper proposes joint decoding algorithm for end-to-end ASR with a hybrid CTC/attention architecture, which effectively utilizes both advantages in decoding. We have applied the proposed method to two ASR benchmarks (spontaneous Japanese and Mandarin Chinese), and showing the comparable performance to conventional state-of-the-art DNN/HMM ASR systems without linguistic resources."

"Morphologically rich languages accentuate two properties of distributional vector space models: 1) the difficulty of inducing accurate representations for low-frequency word forms; and 2) insensitivity to distinct lexical relations that have similar distributional signatures. These effects are detrimental for language understanding systems, which may infer that  'inexpensive' is a rephrasing for 'expensive' or may not associate 'acquire' with 'acquires'. In this work, we propose a novel morph-fitting procedure which moves past the use of curated semantic lexicons for improving distributional vector spaces. Instead, our method injects morphological constraints generated using simple language-specific rules, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart. In intrinsic evaluation over four languages, we show that our approach: 1) improves low-frequency word estimates; and 2) boosts the semantic quality of the entire word vector collection. Finally, we show that morph-fitted vectors yield large gains in the downstream task of dialogue state tracking, highlighting the importance of morphology for tackling long-tail phenomena in language understanding tasks."

"We introduce a new multi-modal task for computer systems, posed as a combined vision-language comprehension challenge: identifying the most suitable text describing a scene, given several similar options. Accomplishing the task entails demonstrating comprehension beyond just recognizing ``keywords'' (or key-phrases) and their corresponding visual concepts. Instead, it requires an alignment between the representations of the two modalities that achieves a visually-grounded ``understanding'' of various linguistic elements and their dependencies. This new task also admits an easy-to-compute and well-studied metric: the accuracy in detecting the true target among the decoys.  The paper makes several contributions: an effective and extensible mechanism for generating decoys from (human-created) image captions; an instance of applying this mechanism, yielding a large-scale machine comprehension dataset (based on the COCO images and captions) that we make publicly available; human evaluation results on this dataset, informing a performance upper-bound; and several baseline and competitive learning approaches that illustrate the utility of the proposed task and dataset in advancing both image and language comprehension. We also show that, in a                    multi-task learning setting, the performance on the proposed task is positively correlated with the end-to-end task of image captioning."

"Distributions over strings and trees can be represented by probabilistic regular languages, which characterize many models in natural language processing. Recently, several datasets have become available which represent natural language phenomena as graphs, so it is natural to ask whether there is an equivalent of probabilistic regular languages for graphs. To answer this question, we review three families of graph languages: Hyperedge Replacement Languages (HRL), which can be made probabilistic; Monadic Second Order Languages (MSOL), which support the crucial property of closure under intersection; and Regular Graph Languages (RGL; \citealt{Courcelle:V}), a subfamily of both HRL and MSOL which inherits these properties, and has not been widely studied or applied to NLP. We prove that RGLs are closed under intersection and provide an efficient parsing algorithm, with runtime linear in the size of the input graph."

"Interactive topic models are powerful tools for those seeking to understand large collections of text. However, existing sampling-based interactive topic modeling approaches scale poorly to large data sets. Anchor methods, which use a single word to uniquely identify a topic, offer the speed needed for interactive work but lack both a mechanism to inject prior knowledge and lack the intuitive semantics needed for user-facing applications. We propose combinations of words as anchors, go- ing beyond existing single word anchor algorithms—an approach we call “Tan- dem Anchors”. We begin with a synthetic investigation of this approach then apply the approach to interactive topic modeling in a user study and compare it to interac- tive and non-interactive approaches. Tan- dem anchors are faster and more intuitive than existing interactive approaches."

In this approach, artificial data is automatically generated according to the experimenter's specifications. The content of the data, both during training and evaluation, can be controlled in detail, which enables tasks to be created which require generalization abilities, in particular the combination of previously introduced concepts in novel ways. We demonstrate the potential of our methodology by evaluating a multimodal architecture on four different tasks, and show that our framework gives us insights into the model's capabilities and limitations."

"Previous work has modeled the compositionality of words by creating character-level models of meaning, reducing problems of sparsity for rare words. However, in many writing systems compositionality has an effect even on the character-level: the meaning of a character is derived by the sum of its parts. In this paper, we model this effect by creating embeddings for characters based on their visual characteristics, creating an image for the character and running it through a convolutional neural network to produce a visual character embedding. Experiments on a text classification task demonstrate that such model allows for better processing of instances with rare characters in languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Additionally, qualitative analyses demonstrate that our proposed model learns to focus on the parts of characters that carry topical content which resulting in embeddings that are coherent in visual space."
"We propose a general framework for performing cross-context lexical                  analysis; that is, analyzing similarities and differences in term meaning         and representation with respect to different, potentially overlapping             partitions of a text collection.                                                       We apply our framework to three different tasks: semantic change detection        (discovering words whose meanings changed over time), comparative lexical         analysis over context (finding context-sensitive and                              context-\emph{in}sensitive terms), and word representation comparison             (investigating randomness inherent in word embeddings)."

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promising performance for language modeling. However, traditional training of RNNs using back-propagation through time often suffers from overfitting. One reason for this is that stochastic optimization (used for large training sets) does not provide good estimates of model uncertainty. This paper leverages recent advances in stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (also appropriate for large training sets) to learn weight uncertainty in RNNs. It yields a principled Bayesian learning algorithm, adding gradient noise during training (enhancing exploration of the model-parameter space) and model averaging when testing. Extensive experiments on various RNN models and across a broad range of applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach relative to stochastic optimization."

"Neural networks have recently shown promising results for relation extraction. State-of-the-art models cast the task as an end-to-end problem, solved incrementally using a local classifier. Yet previous work using statistical models have demonstrated that global optimization can achieve better performances compared to local classification. We build a globally optimized neural model for end-to-end relation extraction, proposing novel LSTM features in order to better learn representations. Experiments show that our model is highly effective, achieving the best performances on two standard benchmarks."
"The existing word representation methods mostly limit their information source to word co-occurrence statistics. In this paper, we introduce ngrams into four representation methods: SGNS, GloVe, PPMI matrix and its SVD factorization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on word analogy and similarity tasks. The results show that improved word representations are learned from ngram co-occurrence statistics. We also demonstrate that the trained ngram representations are useful in many aspects such as finding antonyms and collocations. Besides, a novel approach of building co-occurrence matrix is proposed to alleviate the hardware burden brought by ngrams."

"Pre-trained word embeddings learned from unlabeled text have become a stan- dard component of neural network archi- tectures for NLP tasks. However, in most cases, the recurrent network that oper- ates on word-level representations to pro- duce context sensitive representations is trained on relatively little labeled data. In this paper, we demonstrate a general semi-supervised approach for adding pre- trained context embeddings from bidi- rectional language models to NLP sys- tems and apply it to sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our model on two stan- dard datasets for named entity recognition (NER) and chunking, and in both cases achieve state of the art results, surpassing previous systems that use other forms of transfer or joint learning with additional labeled data and task specific gazetteers."

"We show that relation extraction can be reduced to answering simple reading comprehension questions, by associating one or more natural-language questions with each relation slot. This reduction has several advantages: we can (1) learn high-quality relation-extraction models by extending recent neural reading-comprehension techniques, (2) build very large training sets for those models by combining relation-specific crowd-sourced questions with distant supervision, and even (3) do zero-shot learning by extracting new relations that are only specified at test-time, for which we have no labeled training examples. Experiments on a Wikipedia slot-filling task demonstrate that the approach can generalize to new questions for known relations with high accuracy, and that zero-shot generalization to unseen relations is possible, at lower accuracy levels, setting the bar for future work on this task."

"Word embeddings are used with success for a variety of tasks involving lexical semantic similarities between individual words. Using unsupervised methods and just cosine similarity, encouraging results were obtained for analogical similarities. In this paper, we explore the potential of pre-trained word embeddings to identify generic types of semantic relations in an unsupervised experiment. We propose a new relational similarity measure based on the combination of word2vec's CBOW input and output vectors which outperforms concurrent vector representations, when used for unsupervised clustering on SemEval 2010 Relation Classification data."

"We present Grid Beam Search (GBS), an algorithm which extends beam search to allow the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints. The algorithm can be used with any model which generates sequences token by token. Lexical constraints take the form of phrases or words that must be present in the output sequence. This is a very general way to incorporate auxillary knowledge into a model's output without requiring any modification of the parameters or training data. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of Lexically Constrained Decoding by conducting experiments on Neural Interactive-Predictive Translation, as well as Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation. Experiments show that GBS can provide large improvements in translation quality in interactive scenarios, and that, even without any user input, GBS can be used to achieve significant gains in performance in domain adaptation scenarios."
"Parsing sentences to linguistically-expressive semantic representations is a key goal of Natural Language Processing. Yet statistical parsing has focussed almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation."
"The goal of open information extraction (OIE) is to extract surface relations and their arguments from natural language text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. In this paper, we explore how overly-specific extractions can be reduced in OIE systems without producing uninformative or inaccurate results. We propose MinIE, an OIE system that produces minimized, annotated extractions. At its heart, MinIE rewrites OIE extractions by (1) identifying and removing parts that are considered overly specific; (2) representing information about polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities with suitable annotations instead of in the actual extraction. We conducted an experimental study with several real-world datasets and found that MinIE achieves competitive or higher precision and recall than most prior systems, while at the same time producing much shorter extractions."
"Reading comprehension in NLP refers to the ability of models to answer any question about a passage accurately. An important open problem is how to effectively use external knowledge to answer such questions. In this paper, we introduce a new task and derive new models to drive progress towards this goal. In particular, we propose the task of rare entity prediction: given a web document with several entities removed, models are tasked with predicting the correct missing entities conditioned on the document context and the lexical resources. This task is challenging due to the diversity of language styles and the extremely large number of rare entities. Our experiments show that models that make use of external knowledge in the form of lexical resources, particularly our model using hierarchical LSTMs, perform significantly better at rare entity prediction than those that do not."

"Harnessing the statistical power of neural networks to perform language understanding and symbolic reasoning is difficult, when it requires executing efficient discrete operations against a large knowledge-base. In this work, we introduce a Neural Symbolic Machine, which contains (a) a neural ""programmer"", i.e., a sequence-to-sequence model that maps language utterances to programs and utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality (b) a symbolic ""computer"", i.e., a Lisp interpreter that performs program execution, and helps find good programs by pruning the search space. We apply REINFORCE to directly optimize the task reward of this structured prediction problem. To train with weak supervision and improve the stability of REINFORCE, we augment it with an iterative maximum-likelihood training process. NSM outperforms the state-of-the-art on the WebQuestionsSP dataset when trained from question-answer pairs only, without requiring any feature engineering or domain-specific knowledge."

"Current state-of-the-art models for lexical substitution -- the task of nominating substitutes for a word in context -- ignore word sense, instead relying on powerful vector and embedded word representations to find good substitutes. We present a simple method for improving the lexical substitution rankings of existing models by integrating word sense inventories, filtering substitutes from the correct sense to the top of the rankings. To enable maximum coverage of our method, we also propose a novel method for clustering paraphrases by word sense with substitutability in mind. Our method results in sense clusters that are more substitutable and have wider coverage than existing sense inventories. They can be applied as a filter over lexical substitution rankings generated by existing vector- and embedding-based ranking models to significantly improve their performance."

"This paper presents ArgRewrite, a corpus of between-draft revisions of argumentative essays. Drafts are manually aligned at the sentence level, and the writer’s purpose for each revision is annotated with categories analogous to those used in argument mining and discourse analysis. The corpus should enable advanced research in writing comparison and revision analysis, as demonstrated via our own studies of student revision behavior and of automatic revision purpose prediction."
"This paper proposes KB-InfoBot - a multi-turn dialogue agent which helps users search Knowledge Bases (KBs) without composing complicated queries. Such goal-oriented dialogue agents typically need to interact with an external database to access real-world knowledge. Previous systems achieved this by issuing a symbolic query to the KB to retrieve entries based on their attributes. However, such symbolic operations break the differentiability of the system and prevent end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents. In this paper, we address this limitation by replacing symbolic queries with an induced ``soft'' posterior distribution over the KB that indicates which entities the user is interested in. Integrating the soft retrieval process with a reinforcement learner leads to higher task success rate and reward in both simulations and against real users. We also present a fully neural end-to-end agent, trained entirely from user feedback, and discuss its application towards personalized dialogue agents."
"Bi-directional LSTMs have emerged as a standard method for obtaining per-token vector representations serving as input to various token labeling tasks (whether followed by Viterbi prediction or independent classification).  This paper proposes an alternative to Bi-LSTMs for this purpose: iterated dilated convolutional neural networks (ID-CNNs), which have better capacity than traditional CNNs for large context and structured prediction.  We describe a distinct combination of network structure, parameter sharing and training procedures that is not only more accurate than Bi-LSTM-CRFs, but also 8x faster at test time on long sequences.  Moreover, ID-CNNs with independent classification enable a dramatic 14x test-time speedup, while still attaining accuracy comparable to the Bi-LSTM-CRF.  We further demonstrate the ability of ID-CNNs to combine evidence over long sequences by demonstrating their improved accuracy on whole-document (rather than per-sentence) inference.  Unlike LSTMs whose sequential processing on sentences of length N requires O(N) time even in the face of parallelism, IDCNNs permit fixed-depth convolutions to run in parallel across entire documents.  Today when many companies run basic NLP on the entire web and large-volume traffic, faster methods are paramount to saving time and energy costs."

"Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem.  Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem.We present an evaluation model (ADEM)that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores.   We show that the ADEM model’s predictions correlate significantly,  and at a level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue mod-els unseen during training,                    an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation."
"We introduce a new deep learning model for semantic role labeling (SRL) that significantly improves the state of the art, along with detailed analyses to reveal its strengths and limitations. We use a deep highway BiLSTM architecture with constrained decoding, while observing a number of recent best practices for initialization and regularization. Our 8-layer ensemble model achieves 83.2 F1 on theCoNLL 2005 test set and 83.4 F1 on CoNLL 2012, roughly a 10% relative error reduction over the previous state of the art. Extensive empirical analysis of these gains show that (1) deep models excel at recovering long-distance dependencies but can still make surprisingly obvious errors, and (2) that there is still room for syntactic parsers to improve these results."

"Semantic hierarchies construction means to build structure of concepts linked by hypernym-hyponym (``is-a'') relations. A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of hypernym-hyponym (``is-a'') relations. We propose a fusion learning architecture based on word embeddings for constructing semantic hierarchies, composed of discriminative generative fusion architecture and a very simple lexical structure rule for assisting, getting an F1-score of 74.20% with 91.60% precision-value, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset. Subsequently, combining our method with manually-built hierarchies can further improve F1-score to 82.01%. Besides, the fusion learning architecture is language-independent."

"In this paper, we propose a new method for calculating the output layer in neural machine translation systems. The method is based on predicting a binary code for each word and can reduce computation time/memory requirements of the output layer to be logarithmic in vocabulary size in the best case. In addition, we also introduce two advanced approaches to improve the robustness of the proposed model: using error-correcting codes and combining softmax and binary codes. Experiments on two English-Japanese bidirectional translation tasks show proposed models achieve BLEU scores that approach the softmax, while reducing memory usage to the order of less than 1/10 and improving decoding speed on CPUs by x5 to x10."

"In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over documents. Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task--the CNN \& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention."

"In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over documents. Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task--the CNN \& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention."
"Type-level word embeddings use the same set of parameters to represent all instances of a word regardless of its context, ignoring the inherent lexical ambiguity in language. Instead, we embed semantic concepts (or synsets) as defined in WordNet and represent a word token in a particular context by estimating a distribution over relevant semantic concepts. We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase (PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters. We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4% absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4% relative reduction in errors."
"Keyphrase provides highly-summative information that can be effectively used for understanding, organizing and retrieving text content. Though previous studies have provided many workable solutions for automated keyphrase extraction, they commonly divided the to-be-summarized content into multiple text chunks, then ranked and selected the most meaningful ones. These approaches could neither identify keyphrases that do not appear in the text, nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. We propose a generative model for keyphrase prediction with an encoder-decoder framework, which can effectively overcome the above drawbacks.  We name it as \textit{deep keyphrase generation} since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the content with a deep learning method. Empirical analysis on six datasets demonstrates that our proposed model not only achieves a significant performance boost on extracting keyphrases that appear in the source text, but also can generate absent keyphrases based on the semantic meaning of the text. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/memray/seq2seq-keyphrase."

"Our goal is to create a convenient natural language interface for performing well-specified but complex actions such as analyzing data, manipulating text, and querying databases. However, existing natural language interfaces for such tasks are quite primitive compared to the power one wields with a programming language. To bridge this gap, we start with a core programming language and allow users to ``naturalize'' the core language incrementally by defining alternative, more natural syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of compositions of simpler ones. In a voxel world, we show that a community of users can simultaneously teach a common system a diverse language and use it to build hundreds of complex voxel structures. Over the course of three days, these users went from using only the core language to using the naturalized language in 85.9\% of the last 10K utterances."

"The ambitious goal of this work is to develop a cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework for 282 languages that exist in Wikipedia. Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an English Knowledge Base (KB) if it is linkable. We achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods: generating ``silver-standard'' annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links. Both name tagging and linking results for 282 languages are promising on Wikipedia data and on-Wikipedia data."

This paper proposes to tackle open-domain question answering using Wikipedia as the unique knowledge source: the answer to any factoid question is a text span in a Wikipedia article. This task of machine reading at scale combines the challenges of document retrieval (finding the relevant articles) with that of machine comprehension of text (identifying the answer spans from those articles). Our approach combines a search component based on bigram hashing and TF-IDF matching with a multi-layer recurrent neural network model trained to detect answers in Wikipedia paragraphs. Our experiments on multiple existing QA datasets indicate that (1) both modules are highly competitive with respect to existing counterparts and (2) multitask learning using distant supervision on their combination is an effective complete system on this challenging task.

"We present in this paper a novel framework for morpheme segmentation which uses the morpho-syntactic regularities preserved by word representations, in addition to orthographic features, to segment words into morphemes. This framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic  information for this task. We also analyze the deficiencies  of  available benchmarking datasets and introduce our own dataset that was created on the basis of compositionality.  We validate our algorithm across datasets and present state-of-the-art results."

"We present an approach to rapidly and easily build natural language interfaces to databases for new domains, whose performance improves over time based on user feedback, and requires minimal intervention. To achieve this, we adapt neural sequence models to map utterances directly to SQL with its full expressivity, bypassing any intermediate meaning representations. These models are immediately deployed online to solicit feedback from real users to flag incorrect queries. Finally, the popularity of SQL facilitates gathering annotations for incorrect predictions using the crowd, which is directly used to improve our models. This complete feedback loop, without intermediate representations or database specific engineering, opens up new ways of building high quality semantic parsers. Experiments suggest that this approach can be deployed quickly for any new target domain, as we show by learning a semantic parser for an online academic database from scratch."

"Framing is a political strategy in which politicians carefully word their statements in order to control public perception of issues. Previous works exploring political framing typically analyze frame usage in longer texts, such as congressional speeches. We present a collection of weakly supervised models which harness collective classification to predict the frames used in political discourse on the microblogging platform, Twitter. Our global probabilistic models show that by combining both lexical features of tweets and network-based behavioral features of Twitter, we are able to increase the average, unsupervised F1 score by 21.52 points over a lexical baseline alone."

"How fake news goes viral via social media? How does its propagation pattern differ from real stories? In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on their propagation structure. We firstly model microblog posts diffusion with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-of-the-art rumor detection models."
"This paper presents a new graph-based approach that induces synsets using synonymy dictionaries and word embeddings. First, we build a weighted graph of synonyms extracted from commonly available resources, such as Wiktionary. Second, we apply word sense induction to deal with ambiguous words. Finally, we cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets. Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm to perform a fuzzy clustering of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our approach shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on three gold standard datasets for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical resources."

"Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance across a broad range of applications. However, their application to parsing and generating text using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) has been limited, due to the relatively limited amount of labeled data and the non-sequential nature of the AMR graphs.  We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs.  For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the current best score reported without significant use of external semantic resources. For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of BLEU 33.8.  We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong evidence that sequence-based AMR models are robust against ordering variations of graph-to-sequence conversions."

We present a joint modeling approach to identify salient discussion points in spoken meetings as well as to label the discourse relations between speaker turns. A variation of our model is also discussed when discourse relations are treated as latent variables. Experimental results on two popular meeting corpora show that our joint model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches for both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction tasks. We also evaluate our model on predicting the consistency among team members' understanding of their group decisions. Classifiers trained with features constructed from our model achieve significant better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art.
"Recurrent Neural Networks are showing much promise in many sub-areas of natural language processing, ranging from document classification to machine translation to automatic question answering. Despite their promise, many recurrent models have to read the whole text word by word, making it slow to handle long documents. For example, it is difficult to use a recurrent network to read a book and answer questions about it. In this paper, we present an approach of reading text while skipping irrelevant information if needed. The underlying model is a recurrent network that learns how far to jump after reading a few words of the input text. We employ a standard policy gradient method to train the model to make discrete jumping decisions. In our benchmarks on four different tasks, including number prediction, sentiment analysis, news article classification and automatic Q\&A, our proposed model, a modified LSTM with jumping, is up to 6 times faster than the standard sequential LSTM, while maintaining the same or even better accuracy."
"We study a \emph{symmetric collaborative dialogue} setting in which two agents, each with private knowledge, must strategically communicate to achieve a common goal. The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for existing dialogue systems. We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. To model both structured knowledge and unstructured language, we propose a neural model with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that evolve as the dialogue progresses. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective at achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based models."

"We present a method for metaphor identification based on an explicitly geometric approach to modelling salient lexical associations, and test it on a task of distinguishing metaphoric from literal uses of adjective-noun phrases. By contextually projecting candidate word pairs into interpretably geometric spaces, we show that it obtains state-of-the-art performance, while providing a method which is effectively \emph{zero-shot} -- able to be applied to new unseen phrases. Our dynamically context-sensitive model is inspired by theoretical insight into the situational nature of language and cognition."

"We presents in this paper our approach for modeling inter-topic preferences of Twitter users: for example, ""those who agree with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) also agree with free trade"". This kind of knowledge is useful not only for stance detection across multiple topics but also for various real-world applications including public opinion survey, electoral prediction, electoral campaigns, and online debates. In order to extract users' preferences on Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people agree and disagree about specific topics (e.g., ""A is completely wrong''). By applying these linguistic patterns to a collection of tweets, we extract statements agreeing and disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous work on item recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as matrix factorization: representing users' preference as a user-topic matrix and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our presented approach is useful in predicting missing preferences of users and that the latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic preferences."
"While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress recently, it still suffers from the data scarcity problem for low-resource language pairs and domains. In this paper, we propose a method for zero-resource NMT by assuming that parallel sentences have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language. Based on the assumption, our method is able to train a source-to-target NMT model (``student'') without parallel corpora available guided by an existing pivot-to-target NMT model (``teacher'') on a source-pivot parallel corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves over a baseline pivot-based model by +3.0 BLEU points across various language pairs."

"Knowledge bases are important resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks but suffer from incompleteness. We propose a novel embedding model, ITransF, to perform knowledge base completion. Equipped with a sparse attention mechanism, ITransF discovers hidden concepts of relations and transfer statistical strength through the sharing of concepts. Moreover, the learned associations between relations and concepts, which are represented by sparse attention vectors, can be interpreted easily. We evaluate ITransF on two benchmark datasets---WN18 and FB15k for knowledge base completion and obtains improvements on both the mean rank and Hits@10 metrics, over all baselines that do not use additional information."
The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks has become the state-of-the-art model for a range of different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks especially in language modeling and sequence to sequence learning. In this paper we leverage a bidirectional LSTM while at the same time taking advantage of other semantic resources in order to create a vector space model for words and senses that outperforms most popular algorithms for learning embeddings.  We evaluate our approach on the most well-known benchmarks on vector space representations.
"Text similarity measures are used in multiple tasks such as plagiarism detection, information ranking and recognition of paraphrases and textual entailment. While recent advances in deep learning highlighted the relevance of sequential models in natural language generation, existing similarity measures do not fully exploit the sequential nature of language. Examples of such similarity measures include n-grams and skip-grams overlap which rely on distinct slices of the input texts. In this paper we present a novel text similarity measure inspired from a common representation in DNA sequence alignment algorithms. The new measure, called TextFlow, represents input text pairs as continuous curves and uses both the actual position of the words and sequence matching to compute the similarity value. Our experiments on 8 different datasets show very encouraging results in paraphrase detection, textual entailment recognition and ranking relevance."
"Learning commonsense knowledge from natural language text is nontrivial due to reporting bias: people rarely state the obvious, e.g., “My house is bigger than me.” However, while rarely stated explicitly, this trivial everyday knowledge does influence the way people talk about the world, which provides indirect clues to reason about the world. For example, a statement like, “Tyler entered his house” implies that his house is bigger than Tyler.  In this paper, we present an approach to infer relative physical knowledge of actions and objects along five dimensions (e.g., size, weight, and strength) from unstructured natural language text. We frame knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two closely related problems: learning (1) relative physical knowledge of object pairs and (2) physical implications of actions when applied to those object pairs. Empirical results demonstrate that it is possible to extract knowledge of actions and objects from language and that joint inference over different types of knowledge improves performance."

"We consider the problem of parsing natural language descriptions into source code written in a general-purpose programming language like Python. Existing data-driven methods treat this problem as a language generation task without considering the underlying syntax of the target programming language. Informed by previous work in semantic parsing, in this paper we propose a novel neural architecture powered by a grammar model to explicitly capture the target syntax as prior knowledge. Experiments find this an effective way to scale up to generation of complex programs from natural language descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art results that well outperform previous code generation and semantic parsing approaches."

"The large and growing amounts of online scholarly data present both challenges and opportunities to enhance knowledge discovery. One such challenge is to automatically extract a small set of keyphrases from a document that can accurately describe the document's content and can facilitate fast information processing. In this paper, we propose PositionRank, an unsupervised  model for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents that incorporates information from all positions of a word's occurrences into a biased PageRank. Our model obtains remarkable improvements in performance over PageRank models that do not take into account word positions as well as over strong baselines for this task.  Specifically, on several datasets of research papers, PositionRank achieves improvements as high as $29.09\%$."
"Sarcasm is a form of speech in which speakers say the opposite of what they truly mean in order to convey a strong sentiment. In other words, ”Sarcasm is the giant chasm between what I say, and the person who doesn’t get it.”. In this paper we present the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as the generation of a non-sarcastic utterance conveying the same message as the original sarcastic one. We introduce a novel dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges. Addressing the task as monolingual machine translation (MT), we experiment with MT algorithms and evaluation measures. We then present SIGN: an MT based sarcasm interpretation algorithm that targets sentiment words, a defining element of textual sarcasm. We show that while the scores of n-gram based automatic measures are similar for all interpretation models, SIGN’s interpretations are scored higher by humans for adequacy and sentiment polarity. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions for our new task."

"We have developed an automated Japanese short-answer scoring and support machine for new National Center written test exams. Our approach is based on the fact that recognizing textual entailment and/or synonymy has been almost impossible for several years. The system generates automated scores on the basis of evaluation criteria or rubrics, and human raters revise them. The system determines semantic similarity between the model answers and the actual written answers as well as a certain degree of semantic identity and implication. Owing to the need for the scoring results to be classified at multiple levels, we use random forests to utilize many predictors effectively rather than use support vector machines. An experimental prototype operates as a web system on a Linux computer. We compared human scores with the automated scores for a case in which 3--6 allotment points were placed in 8 categories of a social studies test as a trial examination. The differences between the scores were within one point for 70--90 percent of the data when high semantic judgment was not needed."

Our approach is based on the fact that recognizing textual entailment and/or synonymy has been almost impossible for several years. The system generates automated scores on the basis of evaluation criteria or rubrics, and human raters revise them. The system determines semantic similarity between the model answers and the actual written answers as well as a certain degree of semantic identity and implication. Owing to the need for the scoring results to be classified at multiple levels, we use random forests to utilize many predictors effectively rather than use support vector machines. An experimental prototype operates as a web system on a Linux computer. We compared human scores with the automated scores for a case in which 3--6 allotment points were placed in 8 categories of a social studies test as a trial examination. The differences between the scores were within one point for 70--90 percent of the data when high semantic judgment was not needed."
